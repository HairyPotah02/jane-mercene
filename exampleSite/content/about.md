My Name is Jane Melory P. Mercene, and I'm 21 years old. I'm a BS Psychology student in my second year at Our Lady of Fatima University. I Chose to study BS Psychology because I enjoy interacting with others. I think it's intriguing to learn about human behavior because we interact with it every day. Because life is about connections, it's important to know how to deal with people who have various personalities. I've always considered myself to be an introvert. I prefer spending weekends at home alone, and I've often gone for days at a time without speaking to anyone, and it hasn't affected my personal happiness.
